            <p>It’s all about that lightbulb moment..</p> 
            
            <p>That’s what keeps me going day to day. No matter how new and complex an idea could be. It’s what makes me grow as a designer.</p>

                        <h3>Door Hanger</h3>
						
                        <p> These pieces were created for the Ombudsman of the Algonquin College. They were for the Rez students and it was to create awareness that they existed.</p>

<p>I car up with the concept of using the entire width of a door hanger and create 4 students no showing their faces and taking the courage to go to the ombudsman and confront their issue.

This was a way to show trust towards the Ombudsman and confidence to actually take action.</p>

                        <h3>Ticket Holder</h3>
						<p>The Algonquin Theatre wanted a ticket holder design for their business, they cater towards students as well as the general public. They wanted to look serious but yet inviting.</p>
                        <p>I decided to go with black on black design. The icons created represent and action or situation that happens at the theatre.</p>
                        <p>There would all have a varnish and be printed on a sturdy stock. The reflection of the light will show these cute design but yet stay dark and sophisticated. this will also help the ticket be the life of the party and pump people for the show they would be going to.</p>

						<p>I love sushi and I go to Sushi Kan all the time. As a fun self initiated project I decided to do a rebrand their logo as to how I would see them improve but yet keeping some of their essence and also choosing a different colour to represent sushi as to the typical seaweed green.</p>

                        <h3>Displerk</h3>
						<p>Coming up with Displerk was a fun interactive project. I explored with the Pilot Parallel pens. They are very nice to work with when making calligraphy. The main letter I focused on was the lower case “e” and the rest were based off of it, using tracing paper and black markers. After creating the letters I made these cute posters with bright colours.</p>
